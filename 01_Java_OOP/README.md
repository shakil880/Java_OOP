# Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

## Overview
Java is an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** language. OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data (attributes) and code (methods).

## What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming is a way of organizing and structuring code by grouping related data and functions together into objects. This makes code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

## Core Principles of OOP

### 1. **Encapsulation**
Bundling data and methods that work on that data within a single unit (class), and restricting access to some components.

### 2. **Inheritance**
Creating new classes from existing classes, allowing code reuse and establishing relationships between classes.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
The ability of objects to take many forms - same method name but different implementations.

### 4. **Abstraction**
Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.

## Why Use OOP?

### Advantages:
- ✅ **Modularity**: Code is organized into separate objects
- ✅ **Reusability**: Classes can be reused in different programs
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Easier to update and modify code
- ✅ **Security**: Data hiding through encapsulation
- ✅ **Real-world modeling**: Objects represent real-world entities

## OOP vs Procedural Programming

| Procedural | Object-Oriented |
|------------|-----------------|
| Functions and data are separate | Data and functions are bundled together |
| Top-down approach | Bottom-up approach |
| Less secure | More secure (encapsulation) |
| Harder to modify | Easier to maintain |

## Key OOP Concepts in Java

1. **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects
2. **Object**: An instance of a class
3. **Attribute**: A variable within a class (data)
4. **Method**: A function within a class (behavior)
5. **Constructor**: Special method to initialize objects
6. **Modifier**: Keywords that set access levels

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a **Class** as a blueprint for a house:
- The blueprint defines rooms, doors, windows (attributes)
- It defines actions like open door, turn on lights (methods)
- Each actual house built from the blueprint is an **Object**
- Different houses can have different colors, sizes (different values)

## Example Concept
```java
// Class: Blueprint
class Car {
    // Attributes: Data
    String brand;
    String color;
    
    // Method: Behavior
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

// Object: Instance
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.drive();
```
